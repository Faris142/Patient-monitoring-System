##Patient Monitoring System
#Project Description
The Patient Monitoring System is designed to ensure the safety and health of elderly and patients by using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Inspired by a prior computer vision project dealing with images of human postures like falling and sneezing, this system aims to monitor individuals in real-time using a camera.

Our system focuses on detecting various medical conditions, such as falls, persistent coughing, and other physical abnormalities. When an emergency, such as a fall, is detected, an alert is immediately sent to the responsible person. Similarly, continuous coughing triggers a warning about a possible abnormal condition.

Instead of using a physical sensor, the project includes a simulator for monitoring heartbeat. This simulator provides a continuous and realistic representation of a heartbeat to support the overall functionality of the monitoring system.

The project encompasses detection for multiple medical conditions, specifically targeting six different types. These conditions are integrated into the system to provide comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities, ensuring timely intervention and care for those being monitored.
